<!-- this is about myself -->
	<p class = "about">Tell me about yourself: <br>
	After I graduated in College as IT, I always wanted
	to have good a career path in IT Industry, specifically in Programming,
	but unfortunately, I didn't get the position I wanted to be, Instead,
	I got a job as Quality Assurance in Graphic Industry
	I worked there for almost 5 years. I learned that if you felt that 
	you are not growing, along the way you will get tired. So I decided 
	to study again. Good thing I found Tuitt. </p>
